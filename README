-= Project summary =-

A common problem with the N64 controllers is the joystick. It wears down and 
become unusable. However Gamecube controllers don't seem to wear down much 
and are quite similar to the N64 controllers.

So I've been asked many times if I could design an adapter for using Gamecube 
controllers on a N64 system. This project is the result.
